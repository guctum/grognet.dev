      <description>Who is Greg? I&amp;rsquo;m an obsevability engineer focused on Kubernetes, platforms, and automation. I&amp;rsquo;m known for bringing a collaborative approach to any task.&#xA;I spent the first few years of my career as a Java engineer, building out Spring Boot web services. The neeed for observability introduced me to Dynatrace, adding APM as a skill in my toolkit. The opportunity to join Dynatrace presented itself at the right time, and I&amp;rsquo;ve grown into a lead engineer role within the Dynatrace Support organization.</description>
