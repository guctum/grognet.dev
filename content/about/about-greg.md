## Who is Greg?

I'm an obsevability engineer focused on Kubernetes, platforms, and automation. I'm known for bringing a collaborative approach to any task.

I spent the first few years of my career as a Java engineer, building out Spring Boot web services. The neeed for observability introduced me to Dynatrace, adding APM as a skill in my toolkit. The opportunity to join Dynatrace presented itself at the right time, and I've grown into a lead engineer role within the Dynatrace Support organization.

I now spend my days solving critical tickets revolving around Kubernetes clusters and Linux systems, and have taken on more and more project work to drive innovation and improvements. From taking ownership of technical interviews to maintaining internal reproduction Kubernetes clusters to writing documentation, no day is quite the same.

- Organized and led international on-site knowledge transfer session
- Redesigning technical interview process
- Ownership of and providing white-glove handling of critical at-risk projects
