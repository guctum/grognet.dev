# Who is Greg?

I'm an observability engineer focused on Kubernetes, deep technical troubleshooting, and automation. I'm known for bringing a collaborative and humorous approach to any task.

## General Highlights

I spent the early years of my career as a Java engineer, building out distributed web services. The neeed for insight into complex systems and digital landscapes introduced me to Dynatrace, adding observability and back-line troubleshooting as valuable skills in my toolkit. The opportunity to join Dynatrace presented itself at the right time, and I've grown into a lead engineer role within the Dynatrace Support organization.

I now spend my days solving critical tickets revolving around Kubernetes clusters and distributed systems, and have taken on more and more project work to drive innovation and improvements. From taking ownership of technical interviews to maintaining internal reproduction Kubernetes clusters to writing documentation, no day is quite the same.
